### Todo

* [LS Android style](http://code.livingsocial.net/mobile/android-code-styles)
* read about gradle
* improved error handling (login and registration failures)
* better methods for creating user and user object nesting.
* refactor and move to GH
* implement on save instance state for destinations / trips / etc (so we don't make multiple HTTP requests)
* autopopulate email from existing emails
* custom listview or whatever the new one is
* move our LS android app to swiperefreshlayout
* use parsler, using @parsler annotation
* ice-pick for bundle saving
* build swipe to delete opposed to button.
